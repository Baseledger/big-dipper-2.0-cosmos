# Baseledger

1. docker-compose up -d
2. init postgres db with db-init.sql

3. in codegen.yml change schema to point to v1/graphql and run npm run `npm run graphql:codegen`

4. to run locally `npm run dev`

for prod it seems better to use docker

build docker example:

```
docker build \
--build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_URL="http://localhost:8080/v1/graphql" \
--build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_WS="ws://localhost:8080/v1/graphql" \
--build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_URL="http://localhost:3001" \
--build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_CHAIN_URL="ws://localhost:26657/websocket" \
--build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_STATUS="mainnet" \
--build-arg NODE_ENV="production" \
--build-arg PORT=3001 \
-t DOCKER_ID/big-dipper-baseledger .

```
